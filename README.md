Project to deploy concourse to GCP using Cloud SQL, GCE and cloud-sql-proxy. We will use GCP native resources to deploy and maintain the concourse resources. We avoid using BOSH. Hence we donâ€™t need to deploy and manage the BOSH VM in the concourse project. We use a GCP native replicated PostgreSQL offering. GCP PostgreSQL is currently BETA. We hope it will be GA soon. 

Create a test.tfvars.
```terraform
project_id = "project_id"
network_project_id = "network_project_id"
region = "region"
zone = "zone"
concourse_version = "v3.10.0"
env = "dev"
```


To Apply
```terraform
terraform apply -var-file="test.tfvars"
```
